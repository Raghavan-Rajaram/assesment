We would like you to do the following exercise to show us how you might create a small application using javascript, html and css that consumes a very simple API.

We have created the simplest json file for you here:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/api-fun/books.json


Please build a small javascript-based web application that uses the data from this URL.  

We want to see the authorâ€™s name, birthday and place of birth followed by a list of books. On a desktop view, the books should appear in two columns with 5 books in each.  They should be a single column on a mobile-sized browser. Each book entry in the list should contain the image, the title linked to the purchase URL and the date published.


Bonus: give us a sort toggle that will sort this data alphabetically by title or chronological by publish date.


You may use whatever javascript/css/html libraries, tools and frameworks that you like.  You may also use whatever server and build tools you prefer for this.  


Please deliver the following items:

1. Your source code.

2. Build instructions.  This should run on any webserver, but we will need to know if there are any tools and scripts needed to build your application.  

3. Your built/compressed application files, if applicable.

4. A short paragraph explaining why you chose whatever framework/library.
